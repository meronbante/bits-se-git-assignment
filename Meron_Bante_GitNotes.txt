git is a version control system that helps us manage our files and projects
git does this by:- keeping track of changes made to files history (changes we made , tells us when the change were made,...)
                :-allowing us to collaborate with others on our projects by sharing changes ( this help us to work on the same project by interacting with each other)
                :-providing feature branches that helps us split or breakdown tasks that team members can pick to work on, sfter the team members are done with the task 
                they took , they can merge it into the main repository. it lets us go back and forth from one branch to another if we want to make changes or work on 
                them up untill we are done.
